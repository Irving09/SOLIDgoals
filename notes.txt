Single Responsibility

Open/Closed Principle
	- Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
	- Open for extension => you are able to extend the module with newbehavior and satisfy necessary changes
	- Closed for modification => extending behaviors should NOT result in changes to the source or binary code,
	    whether in a linkable library, a DLL, a Java .jar file, should remain UNTOUCHED.
		
NOTE: any change is allowed to existing code
	  as long as it does NOT also require a change to any client of that code.

Liskov Substitution Principle
	- a collection of guidelines for creating inheritance hierarchies
	  in which a client can reliably use any class or subclass without compromising the expected behavior
