- Interfaces represent the boundaries between what client code requires and how that requirement is implemented.
The interface segregation principle states that interfaces should be small.

- At their simplest, interfaces contain single methods that serve a single purpose. 
At this level of granularity, they are akin to delegates, but with many added benefits

- This chapter works through a complete example that progresses from
a single monolithic interface to multiple smaller interfaces.
